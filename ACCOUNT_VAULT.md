# Password-protected account archive

This feature imports all saved **basic-auth** mail accounts using one archive
password after signing in to the archive owner's mailbox, including on a browser
with empty local storage. It is an explicit
save/restore snapshot; it does not synchronize mail or automatically merge edits.

Each archive has an **owner** (the mailbox that was signed in when it was created)
and a **name**. One owner can keep up to 10 archives, and each browser account can
own its own archives: they are listed together, can be told apart by name and can
be deleted.

## Enable and use

Set `SETTINGS_SYNC_ENABLED=true`, configure `SESSION_SECRET`, and persist
`SETTINGS_DATA_DIR` on a writable volume, for example `/data/settings`.
If admin settings override the environment, enable settings sync there as well.
The archive is unavailable under the OAuth-only policy. Serve webmail and JMAP
over HTTPS.

1. Add the basic-auth accounts on the original browser. To include their passwords,
   connect every account first; a metadata-only archive can include disconnected accounts.
2. In **Settings → Account → Saved accounts**, the **Archive** list shows the archives
   of every basic-auth account in this browser, as “name — owner”. Choose
   **New archive…**, pick the **Account that owns the archive**, then **Create archive**.
   Changing the default mailbox does not move an archive.
3. Give the archive a name, enter and confirm a separate strong archive
   passphrase (at least 10 characters), choose whether to **Include mailbox passwords
   when saving**, then **Save current accounts**. The archive is encrypted even
   when mailbox passwords are excluded; its name is not (see below).
4. On a new browser, sign in normally to the owner's mailbox on the same mail
   server. If it owns archives, a popup offers to import one into this browser,
   with a choice when there are several.
   Choose **Import accounts**, then enter the archive password. Choose whether to
   **Import mailbox passwords too**. With that option off, only the account list
   is imported; missing passwords in an archive have the same behavior.
   The offer does not appear for accounts without an archive. It is not shown
   again in this browser after importing, saving or choosing **Not now**; manual import
   remains available in **Settings → Account → Saved accounts**: select the archive
   and choose **Import accounts**. **Rescan for archives** fetches the current list,
   regardless of a previous dismissal/import.
5. Accounts with imported passwords are connected in a single import. Accounts
   imported without passwords remain visible for manual sign-in; existing live
   sessions and their cookies are preserved. Failed
   accounts remain visible for sign-in; the others remain usable. The optional
   “Keep accounts signed in” checkbox creates the existing per-browser session
   cookies. Without it, unlock again after a reload.

To save again after adding/removing accounts or changing mailbox passwords, select
the archive and choose **Update archive**; the name can be changed there too. Saving
replaces that archive's list with the browser's current basic-auth accounts. All
must be connected when including mailbox passwords. OAuth/SSO tokens are excluded.
Logout does not write or delete server archives.

**Delete archive** removes the selected archive from the server after a confirmation.
It requires being signed in to the owner's mailbox, not the archive password, so an
archive whose password was forgotten can still be removed and recreated. Accounts
already in the browser are not affected.

A browser must have restored or saved the current archive revision before it can
replace it. Concurrent writes are rejected. When a conflict is reported, rescan,
restore the current archive and review the local account list before
saving. Restoring adds/reconnects archived accounts and preserves other local
accounts; there is no implicit cross-device deletion or background synchronization.

## Storage and security boundaries

The browser uses Web Crypto PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256 (600,000 iterations, random 16-byte
salt) and AES-256-GCM (random 12-byte IV). Archive version and owner identity are
authenticated alongside the encrypted contents. The password/key is never sent
to the archive endpoint or stored in local/session storage. Only account metadata,
the import prompt choice and the last known revision of each archive enter local storage.

The server stores each archive as a size-bounded file under
`SETTINGS_DATA_DIR/account-vaults/<owner-hash>/<archive-id>.json`, holding the
encrypted envelope and the archive name. It has no archive decryption
key. **Archive lists and ciphertext downloads intentionally work before mail
authentication** so restoration needs only the archive password. Knowing a
username/server pair can therefore reveal that archives exist, their **names**, and
permit downloading their ciphertext. Names are plaintext: do not put secrets in them.
Use a strong, unique passphrase: copied ciphertext permits offline password guesses.
An installation's existing access controls (for example an access proxy) still apply.

Archive writes and deletions require a matching owner session and a fresh JMAP
credential check; the endpoint never relies solely on the existence of a session
cookie. Body size is checked while streaming, and storage accepts only the name and
the encrypted envelope fields. Atomic file replacement and a per-owner file lock
protect the revision comparison and the per-owner archive limit.

After unlocking, mail credentials go through the existing JMAP login/session
mechanisms; the application backend can process them when issuing session cookies.
Browser-side encryption protects the stored archive, not a compromised running
webmail application or browser. Forgotten archive passwords cannot be recovered;
delete the archive and create a new one. Back up the encrypted files.

File permissions are `0600` and the archive directories are created as `0700`.
After a process crash during a write, an orphan `account-vaults/<owner-hash>/.lock`
file may require removal by an administrator **with all writers stopped**. Do not
remove live lock files.
