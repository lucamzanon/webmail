/**
 * Where the advanced-filter panel is drawn.
 *
 * With no anchor it stays where it has always been: in the flow of the
 * message-list column, directly under the header that carries the filter
 * button. That is the default skin, and nothing about it changes.
 *
 * The Gmail skin moves the filter button up into the global top bar, next to
 * the search field. Given the anchor the top bar renders under that field, the
 * panel drops from it instead, as Gmail's does: same leading edge, same width,
 * directly below.
 *
 * It is portalled to <body> and positioned from the anchor's box rather than
 * rendered inside the anchor. Inside the top bar it shared the root stacking
 * context with the sidebar column, which carries the same z-index and comes
 * later in the document, so the sidebar painted over the panel's leading half.
 * At the end of <body> it wins that tie, and it still loses to any dialog
 * opened afterwards, which is the order one wants.
